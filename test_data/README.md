# Test Data

This directory contains test video files for the AVA application.

## Test Video Requirements

For testing the application, you'll need video files with clear audio speech. The ideal test video should have:

1. Clear spoken content
2. Some visual elements worth capturing (charts, code, presentations)
3. Duration of 1-5 minutes for quick testing

## Example Test Cases

1. **Educational/Tutorial Video**: Contains explanations with visual demonstrations
2. **Presentation Video**: Has slides or charts that would benefit from screenshots
3. **Code Tutorial**: Shows code on screen while explaining concepts

## Usage

1. Place your test video files in this directory
2. Use the AVA application to select and process these files
3. Verify that transcription and screenshots are generated correctly

## Notes

- Ensure FFmpeg is installed on your system
- Have a valid OpenRouter API key ready
- Test with different video formats (MP4, AVI, MOV, etc.)
